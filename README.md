# Optmized-RWMA-Algorithm

This is a modern and more efficient take on the initial RWMA (Randomized weighted majority algorithm) proposed by Avrim Blum in his paper 
The algorithm is largely based on expert's advice model, in which we consider the majority among the probabilities of randomized weights of cumulative result from the experts' opinion. https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~chazelle/courses/BIB/blum-experts.pdf

The improvement over the algorithm proposed over this primitive version, considers an optimal approach based on rewarding of correct expert predictions, which is not considered in the original algorithm. The accuracy of the optimized algorithm is hence found to be ~30% more than the original.
